## Importing travel data

Two node scripts help load travel places into Firestore:

1. `npm run import:travel` â€“ Clears all existing travel documents for the default user and imports `assets/travel/doc.kml`.
2. `npm run append:travel` â€“ Reads `assets/travel/extra.kml` and appends those places to the same user without removing existing ones.

Both scripts expect `serviceAccountKey.json` in the project root and support the Firestore emulator if `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` is set.

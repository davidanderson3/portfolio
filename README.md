## Importing travel data

Two node scripts help load travel places into Firestore:

1. `npm run import:travel` â€“ Clears all existing travel documents for the default user and imports `assets/travel/doc.kml`.
2. `npm run append:travel` â€“ Reads `assets/travel/extra.kml` and appends those places to the same user without removing existing ones.

Both scripts expect `serviceAccountKey.json` in the project root and support the Firestore emulator if `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` is set.

## Running E2E tests

End-to-end tests are written with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). Install
the browsers once and then run the `e2e` script:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
npm run e2e
```

This starts the local server, launches a browser, and exercises basic UI flows.

## Android location snippet

The `android/WeatherLocationHelper.kt` file demonstrates how to obtain the user's current
location with the Fused Location Provider API. It first checks the last known
location and, if unavailable, requests a single high accuracy update.
